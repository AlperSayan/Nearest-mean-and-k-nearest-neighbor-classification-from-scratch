# Nearest-mean-and-k-nearest-neighbor-classification-from-scratch
nearest-mean and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithms on a subset of the MNIST dataset.


1. Implement the nearest-mean classifier. Plot the mean 28x28 images in grayscale. Report the confusion matrices on training and test data.

2. Implement the k-NN classifier. Report the confusion matrix on the test data for k=1. Also for k=1, 3, 5, 7, 9,11, plot the training and test accuracies as a function of k.
